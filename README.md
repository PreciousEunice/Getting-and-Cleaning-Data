## Files
### 1.  CodeBook.md 
It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

### 2.  run_analysis.R 
This R script downloads the data followed by the 5 steps stated in the course projectâ€™s instructions:
-1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
