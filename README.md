# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is a course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course. It contains the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

## R Version
"R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02)"

## Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

## Files
### 1.  CodeBook.md 
It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

### 2.  run_analysis.R 
This R script downloads the data followed by the 5 steps stated in the course projectâ€™s instructions:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
